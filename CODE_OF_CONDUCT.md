# Code of Conduct

We strive to ensure a positive and productive community experience. We are dedicated to maintaining a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all participants, regardless of their background, identity, or characteristics.

## Respectful Communication

  - Refrain from using inappropriate or offensive aliases or nicknames.
  - Engage in respectful and courteous dialogue, avoiding mean-spirited or rude comments.
  - Acknowledge that differing opinions and design choices involve trade-offs and costs, and there is often no single "right" answer.

## Constructive Feedback

  - Minimize unstructured criticism; instead, propose documented solutions with code and benchmarks to support your ideas.
  - Focus on providing constructive feedback that is specific, objective, and actionable.

## Harassment Will Not Be Tolerated

  - We have zero tolerance for harassment, including behavior that excludes or discriminates against socially marginalized groups.
  - Harassment is defined in accordance with the Citizen Code of Conduct.
  - Private harassment is also unacceptable; if you experience or witness harassment, please report it to a Tragedy Labs team member immediately.
  - Spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting, or other attention-seeking behavior is not permitted.
